# PiSumo

A sumo game made with raspberry pi along with EduKit3 from CamJam

This is the first Hackathon project I have done using a RaspberryPi, I enjoyed that it was quite a bit different from stuff and was easier to do than I expected. Plus, robots are cool! I thought that as I had only me the guy I was a team in on the first day I thought we worked well together. This makes me want to do more projects with the RapberryPi especially robotic ones, as I found out that robots are cool especially if you make them your self.
 ## Technology Used
 * RaspberryPi
 * CamJam EduKit3
 * Some random resistors that we found
